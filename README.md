# TipAndTaxCalculator
This is a tip and tax calculator.
It asks for the user's restaurant, what state they are in, what the cost of their bill is, and whether their service was okay, poor or good. It then calculates the tip and tax based on the service and what state the user is in, and returns this information, along with the information that the user inputed, onto a receipt.
