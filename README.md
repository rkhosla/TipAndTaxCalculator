# TipAndTaxCalculator
This is a tip and tax calculator.
It asks for the user's restaurant, what state they are in, what the cost of their bill is, and whether the restaurant's service was poor, okay, or great. It then calculates the tip and tax of the bill based on the restaurant's service and what state the user is in, and returns this information, along with the information that the user inputted, onto a receipt.
